    ALU’s inaugural campus is known as African Leadership College (ALC) in Mauritius. 
    ALC offers accredited <a href=" ">undergraduate degree programmes</a> through its founding academic partner, <a href="https://www.alueducation.com/about/our-founding-academic-partners/">Glasgow Caledonian University</a>. 
    The campus opened its doors to its first class of students in October 2015 with 173 students in the inaugural class of 2015. 
    Today we have organized two graduation ceremonies for over 300 students of our founding batch.
</p>
<h1 class="common">Campus</h1>
<p class="campus">
    ALC’s main campus was inaugurated in early 2018 and is located in Pamplemousses, the northern region of Mauritius, halfway between the capital city, Port Louis, and the bustling expat neighborhood in Grand Baie. 
    Our students have the opportunity to immerse themselves in a diverse culture with historical origins rooted in Asia, Africa, 
    and Europe, all the while enjoying living on a tropical island, often referred to as one of Africa’s safest and most education-driven countries.
</p>
<h1 class="common">Housing</h1>
<p class="housing">
    ALC Mauritius is a fully residential campus. 
    Our facilities are a perfect blend of modern and tropical, with fully-equipped dorms overlooking sugarcane fields, not too far from beautiful beaches.

</p>
<h1 class="common"> Academics</h1>
<p class="academics">
    ALC offers undergraduate degree programmes through our founding academic partner, Glasgow Caledonian University. 
    Our degree programmes have been carefully selected to reflect industries we believe are Africa’s greatest opportunities.
